## About the Stack

We chose the MERN stack which is a popular web development framework that consists of four key technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. It speeds up our development by using React to implement the presentation layer, Express and Node to make up the middle or application layer, and MongoDB to create the database layer.
